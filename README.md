# MutualGuide
This git contains a mutual guide implementation scheme for hyperspectral image classification with small data by exploiting extreme learning machines (ELMs) as base classifiers. 

# Usage
Run main.m matlab

# Datasets
We have uploaded three public hyperspectral image datasets, i.e., Indian Pines, Kennedy Space Center , Pavia University, and Salinas and their corresponding ground truth into the `datasets` folder.

#Parameters
In order to better exhibit the classification performance of our mutual guide method, we have uploaded the different parameters of ELM on the three datasets into the `parameters` folder. Of course, you can make appropriate changes.
